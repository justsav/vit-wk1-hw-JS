            Welcome to RAGBRAI: The Register's Annual Great Bike Ride Across
            Iowa
          </h1>
          <p>
            Every year, thousands of cyclists descend on to the back highways
            and biways of the Hawkeye State to traverse the width of the state
            of Iowa, from East to West over 7 days, on bicycles. The annual
            event began in 1973 and has only increased in popularity with every
            passing year, and a route that changes every year to stop overnight
            in a new set of towns.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 44 years, RAGBRAI has passed through 780 Iowa towns, spent the
            night in 125 different overnight towns. In 2013, an estimated 36,000
            riders were counted on the road from Perry to Des Moines.
